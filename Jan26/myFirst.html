        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2>My name is Yuanchen Li</h2>
        <p>I know EECS1012 is a challenging course, I need to <i>engage</i> really well in problem solving activities from the <strong>first</strong> week of classes for every week </p>
        <p>I have been told that I treat 1012,1022,2030 and 2011 each as a 6-credit course, and really learn the underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy rest of my EECS program. <span style="text-decoration:underline">In fact rest of my life!</span></p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as I am in the EECS business.</span></p>
